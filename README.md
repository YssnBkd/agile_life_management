- **Tagging System**: Categorize tasks, sprints, and goals with customizable tags
- **Notifications**: Get reminders for upcoming deadlines and tasks

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The app follows **Clean Architecture** principles with **MVVM** pattern:

- **Presentation Layer**: Jetpack Compose UI components and ViewModels
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic with use cases, models, and repository interfaces
- **Data Layer**: Repository implementations, local and remote data sources

Key architectural components:
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data sources from the business logic
- **Use Cases**: Encapsulate business rules and operations
- **Dependency Injection**: Modular and testable components using Hilt
- **Reactive Data Flow**: UI updates reactively to data changes

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries

- **UI**: Jetpack Compose with Material 3 design
- **Architecture Components**: ViewModel, LiveData, Room
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt
- **Navigation**: Jetpack Navigation Compose
- **Networking**: Ktor Client
- **Local Database**: Room
- **Backend Services**: Supabase (Auth, PostgreSQL, Storage)
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Kotlin Coroutines and Flow
- **Date/Time**: ThreeTenABP
- **Image Loading**: Coil
- **Logging**: Timber
- **JSON Serialization**: Gson
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
